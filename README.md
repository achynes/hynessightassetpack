Some tools I've thrown together over the years. This started as a foray into generic tooling when I was a much fresher programmer, and much of it from back then is still untested in projects.

Some of the stuff is newer, brought in from actual projects, both professional and personal. There are things I'm not necessarily happy with any more, or undecided on (is Singleton pattern a problem, or just the way it gets used? Either way, we talk about it way too much).

I think the older stuff is overly verbose in style, so I simplify it when I'm in the neighbourhood but otherwise leave it lie.

At some point I might split it into separate Asset Packs instead of this one big one, otherwise I just add things piecemeal as they come up in my projects, though I have a couple of larger tooling ideas I want to get in there at some point too.
